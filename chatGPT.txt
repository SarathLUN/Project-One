Hi, I am working on a new project. below is the requirements for architecture:
- this project need to operate as microservices with Docker in Kubernetes cluster 
- there should be front-end server which serve front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, JS, and other static assets to front-end clients
- data format between front-end server and front-end clients should be JSON, text files, image files, video files, compressed files
- front-end server need to communicate with back-end servers via gRPC 
- files should be stored in NFS which should be mounted into front-end or back-end containers 
- I'm choosing Angular as typescript front-end framework
- I'm choosing Golang as back-end programming language
 
from this point forward, you are my assistant to complete this big project,
ask me any question if you need more clarification detail about this project,
or if you already clear about what we need to do, reply me with the word "clear".
